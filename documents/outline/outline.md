# Project Outline
Here I will plan the five visualization "views" that will compose this project's website and construct the narrative that will lead them from one to the next. I will also plan the structure of the poster in this document.

## Website
#### View 1: Spinning 3D Model
This visualization will be the first graphic the user will see when entering the website and will be set to autoplay and looped to repeat indefinitely. It will be a movie generated in R using `rayshader`, and it will feature a spinning 3D model of the Great Salt Lake. This will be a key visualization to catch the attention of the audience and motivate them to scroll forward into the introduction of the project.

#### Introduction
I will use this section to introduce the topic much like I did in the project proposal. It will read something like this:

> Utah’s Great Salt Lake is rapidly declining due to agricultural overconsumption and demands of the growing population. In addition to failing a long-standing ecosystem, the decline also exposes toxic elements such as arsenic and mercury on the dried-up lakebed to wind that could carry the chemicals into the highly-populated surrounding areas. It’s a serious concern that poses severe consequences for the state of Utah.

#### View 2: Choropleth of Lake Size with Water Elevation by Year (Slider)
My second visualization will illustrate the shape of the lake with a slider that controls the lake's water level by year. Based on available data, this will likely date back to 1966. If there's time, I may also visualize salinity levels by year in this view.

#### View 3: Toxins
I am still deciding how exactly this view will look, but it will illustrate the rise in toxins in different areas around the Great Salt Lake as the lake declines.

#### View 4: Brine Shrimp
To further emphasize the effect that the Great Salt Lake's decline is inflicting on the community, here I will include a view that demonstrates the size of the brine shrimp industry, and brine shrimp populations in the lake by year.

#### View 5: Table
This will include a curated and interactive (filter, sort) table that depicts average yearly statistics for the Great Salt Lake (water level, salinity level), Salt Lake County population, and other relevant statistics by year.
